In the realm of modern business operations, efficient management of employees is crucial for organizational success. To streamline this process, we introduce an Employee Management System built using Apache NetBeans platform, featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed with JFrame, and employing SQLite database for data management. This system is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, utilizing various techniques to ensure scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

Object-Oriented Design Principles Implemented:
Encapsulation:

Encapsulating data within classes to restrict direct access and ensure data integrity.
Example: Employee class encapsulates attributes such as name, age, salary, etc., providing methods to manipulate data securely.
Inheritance:

Utilizing inheritance to establish relationships between classes, promoting code reuse and hierarchical organization.
Example: Employee class may serve as a base class, with subclasses like Manager, Engineer, etc., inheriting common attributes and behaviors.
Polymorphism:

Leveraging polymorphism to enable objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably based on a shared interface.
Example: Implementing an abstract method calculateSalary() in the Employee class, overridden by subclasses to calculate salaries based on specific roles.
Abstraction:

Employing abstraction to define essential features while hiding implementation details, facilitating easier understanding and maintenance.
Example: Using abstract classes or interfaces to define common behaviors and attributes shared among different types of employees.
